In this document you can read how we, Outage Labs Inc. ("Outage Labs", "we", "us" and "our") collect, use and/or share the information we obtain about you. Our services are for an adult audience. Our platforms are for the use of adults. However, we do not control whether minors can download and use it. If you are a minor, we ask that you cease using it.

Any capitalized term that is not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the meaning given in the Terms and Conditions that you should have read or should read if you have not yet done so.

"Personally Identifiable Information" (hereinafter, "PII") is any information that can be used to identify, locate or contact a particular user.

        <div class="ascii-box">
            <p>
                By accepting these terms, we may collect certain information through automated or electronic means, including technology such as cookies, geolocation services, visit counters, analysis tools associated with the web browser, analysis tools associated with our mobile application and web server logs. By using APAGÓN, your browser, the App and your electronic equipment communicate with servers operated by us or by our service providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and comply with the service and information requests submitted by you.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                The collected information is stored in web server logs and also in cookies stored on your computer or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to APAGÓN by your computer or mobile device. These servers are operated and the cookies are managed by Outage Labs or our service providers.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                Geolocation services will allow us to know your geographic location when using APAGÓN or at any other time. This technology collects and sends geolocation data transmitted by your electronic equipment while you keep location services (or GPS) active. This technology will transmit geolocation data when you are using APAGÓN; when you are not using APAGÓN, the data will be transmitted by a program that will operate from the background of your mobile device.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                We may collect information from the hardware devices you use to access APAGÓN; your operating system, programs or browser type (software); domain, cellular carrier and other configurations of your system, such as the language you use, the country and time zone in which you are located. Mobile browsers routinely send this type of information to our servers or to the servers of our service providers. The logs of our servers or the servers of our service providers will also record the IP address that your device uses to interact with APAGÓN. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify themselves and communicate with each other on the internet.

        <div class="ascii-box">
            <p>
                In most cases, the information we collect using other tools will be used in ways that will prevent you from being identified, without any reference to your Personal Information. For example, we will use the information we collect about users to optimize our Services and understand traffic and usage patterns, but we will not know the name or address of a specific user.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                Additionally, if you have visited our website through your mobile device or activated any of our mobile applications, and if the settings on your device allow us to receive your location information, we will collect such information automatically. If we associate geolocation information with your Personal Information, this Privacy Policy will also limit how we can use such information.

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                We will use services provided by third parties to help us understand how our users interact with APAGÓN to improve the user experience.
